# Product Management Analytics Tool

## Project Title & Description
Develop a tool that leverages machine learning to forecast financial performance and project success for product management.

## Key Technologies
- Python (scikit-learn)
- - SQL
  - - Docker
    - - Power BI
      - - Agile/Scrum frameworks
       
        - ### Application to Full-Stack/Backend Development, DevOps, and Product Management (Tech/AI/Agritech) or Data Analytics:
        - - **Python with scikit-learn** is used to build forecasting models, providing predictive insights into product performance.
          - - **SQL** for storing and managing processed data, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.
            - - **Docker** for containerizing the ML service, allowing for consistent deployment across various environments.
              - - **Power BI** to create dashboards that visualize forecasts and key performance indicators (KPIs).
                - - **Agile/Scrum frameworks** to manage the development process, ensuring iterative improvements and adaptability.
                 
                  - ## Project Impact & Results
                  - Supports data-driven product decisions and improves resource allocation.
                 
                  - ## Detailed Steps to Completion
                  - 1. **Collect and Preprocess Historical Product and Financial Data**: Ensure data quality and relevance for model training.
                    2. 2. **Build Forecasting Models Using scikit-learn**: Develop predictive algorithms that provide insights into future performance.
                       3. 3. **Store Processed Data in a SQL Database**: Facilitate efficient data access and management.
                          4. 4. **Package the ML Service in a Docker Container**: Ensure consistent and reliable deployment of the analytics tool.
                             5. 5. **Create a Power BI Dashboard to Visualize Forecasts and KPIs**: Provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards.
